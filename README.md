Key OOP Concepts Demonstrated:
Encapsulation:

Protected attributes with _prefix

Controlled access via methods

Hidden secret identity with getter method

Inheritance:

TechHero and MagicHero inherit from Superhero

Added specialized attributes (_gadgets, _mana)

Extended functionality (use_gadget(), meditate())

Polymorphism:

Overridden use_power() method behaves differently in each subclass

Uniform interface for different hero types

Class Design:

Meaningful constructor parameters

Clear string representation (__str__)

Energy/mana management systems

Example Output:

=== Superhero System ===

========================================
Superhero: Captain Justice
Powers: Super strength, Flight
Base: Justice Tower
- Power usage:
Captain Justice uses Super strength!

========================================
Superhero: Iron Sentinel
Powers: Repulsor beams, Rocket boots
Base: Stark Tower
- Power usage:
Iron Sentinel activates Repulsor beams with tech boost!
Iron Sentinel deploys AI Assistant!

========================================
Superhero: Doctor Mystic
Powers: Reality Warp, Time Manipulation
Base: Sanctum Sanctorum
- Power usage:
Doctor Mystic casts Reality Warp!
Doctor Mystic meditates. Mana: 90%
This implementation shows how to:

Design a class hierarchy

Use inheritance effectively

Implement polymorphic behavior

Protect class internals

Create specialized subclasses
